=======================================

Thank you for downloading Cutscene FPS Unlock â€“ Fully Automatic!

IMPORTANT:
-----------
Do not extract this ZIP to a random folder. You **must** place the files directly into your KingdomComeDeliverance2\Engine folder.

Instructions:
1. Extract this ZIP archive.
2. Copy the file **"fix_fps.bat"** to your **KingdomComeDeliverance2\Engine** folder.
3. *(Optional)* A backup of your **Engine.pak** file will be automatically created as **Engine.pak.backup** when you run the script.  
   **However, creating your own backup beforehand is strongly recommended.**
4. Double-click **"fix_fps.bat"** inside the **KingdomComeDeliverance2\Engine** folder to run the mod.

It is **strongly recommended** that you back up your original **Engine.pak** file (or use the automatically created **Engine.pak.backup**) before applying this mod.
